This small project let users to save, manage bookmarks similar to the browser extension.


Resources:
Great pattern from - https://pattern.monster/doodle-1/
Nice icons from - fontawesome.com 
REgular Expression from -https://regex101.com/


New cool things that I learned:

1. To get the favicon for a domain, use:
https://s2.googleusercontent.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.stackoverflow.com

2. Use Regular expression to validate the URL

3. The Object.keys() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, iterated in the same order that a normal loop would. Applied this to prevent extra looping
